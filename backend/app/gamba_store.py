"""Gamba account durability: mirror gamba_accounts rows to private Hostinger FTP.

Unlike every other table, gamba_accounts is USER data, not a rebuildable cache.
It can't ride archive.py — that JSON is committed to the public repo — and
Render's disk is wiped on every deploy. So every successful write also uploads
{code}.json to HOSTINGER_GAMBA_DIR (home-relative, deliberately OUTSIDE
public_html, so the blobs are never web-served), and boot restores whatever the
redeploy dropped. Empty FTP creds => inert, same as publish.py.

push_async(code)  -> fire-and-forget upload of one account after a write
restore()         -> re-insert every FTP blob the local DB doesn't have
